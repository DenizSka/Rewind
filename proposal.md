Project 2 Proposal

What is Rewind?

Rewind is a fun app that shows you information about the day that you were born.  What were the top 10 hits? What type of news were on the healdine? etc. 

All you have to do is put in your birth date and hit enter. 
If you like to edit the top music or add in your favorite tracks from your time you can simply log in and adjust it according to your preferences. 


Wireframe

Added in as a separate file. 

Initial thoughts on game structure

Initial thought about this projects was to have multiple sources of data from different apis so that whoever puts in the date would get information on top music, top news and the fashion trends. But as a start I want to narrow this down to just one database and see how far I get.

The other challenge is making the full CRUD working. I do not want the client (user) to be able to do any edits to the existing database so I prefer to create another table for them. I want the user to only make edits or deletes when they are logged in with their username and password. And I want to store the information of the user only when they logged in so they can come back and search new things or edits their info whenever they want.

If I can get the username and password to work in the next couple days I would like the user to be able to save their favorite searches. 

This project has a lot of moving parts so I will need to be extra organized and write down each step I am taking. (I need to write down all the errors I will be facing so I would now how to fix them easily later on)


Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)


Phase 1: Creating a repository, documenting each step, showing the progress using issues, adding wireframes, and most importantly commiting the work at the end of each day. 
Phase 2: Testing the free apis and see which ones are fully functioning.
Phase 3: Setting up the localhost page with a dummy database with the basic functionality.
Phase 4: Setting up a username and password functionality.
Phase 5: Moving on the existing api and testing out the CRUD with username and password. 
Phase 6: At the end of this adding ejs node module and start workingon the design and html. 


Date to day to do:
Day 1 Wednesday: Wrote down the proposal, did the wireframes and researched some apis. 
Day 2: Thursday: Based on the free apis out there, I had to update my wireframes. And think more about how to implement the CRUD elements. 
Database - draw out table & columns you plan to use in your database. 
ID, Music Title, Artist, Release Year.

Suggested Steps:
Database - draw out the tables & columns you plan to use in your database (ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram - is a fancy word for it)
Wireframes - detail the flow of your app through simple wireframes
You can choose whether you want to whiteboard the wireframes or use some program.
Refer back to the todo app wireframes for an example of what we expect!
Routes - design the HTTP route architecture of your app
Set up a separate standing github repo (NOT this repo!) and project board for your project
Find an API that you plan on using and test it out
